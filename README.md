# Scheduling Algorithms
1. First-come, first-served (FCFS), which schedules tasks in the order in which they request the CPU.
2. Shortest-job-first (SJF), which schedules tasks in order of the length of the tasksâ€™ next CPU burst.
3. Priority scheduling, which schedules tasks based on priority.
4. Round-robin scheduling, where each task is run for a time quantum (or for the remainder of its CPU burst).
5. Priority with round-robin, which schedules tasks in order of priority and uses round-robin scheduling for tasks with equal priority.
